clone of https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/autocomplete-on/ecpgkdflcnofdbbkiggklcfmgbnbabhh/related

made a clone because i couldn't trust that the other one wouldn't be auto-updated and start stealing my passwords.

I don't trust any extensions that want access to all websites I visit!

Consider making your own clone :-)
